DEBUG in reward_complete_compare: LLM return response: This initial state shows the character inside a room in Pokémon Red. The character is near the bottom part of the room, positioned between a table and a bookshelf, with an NPC (non-playable character) close by. The character’s orientation and positioning suggest they may be either interacting with the NPC or about to exit the conversation. The exit door of the room appears to be at the top of the screen to the right of the NPC.

For the task of "Get out of the room," the relevant action is to guide the character towards the exit. Any future state that moves the character closer to the door or through it would be considered an improvement towards completing this task. If the character moves further from the door or remains in place for subsequent states, it would generally be less favorable in terms of task completion.

Initially, the character was positioned near the center of the room, further away from the door. Now, the character is right near the door, which indicates a state much more favorable to complete the task of getting out of the room.

According to the provided scale, this improvement would be classified as "much better" because the player has turned into a state much more favorable to complete the task compared to the previous state. The action required to complete the task (exiting the room) is now straightforward and requires significantly fewer actions than before.

DEBUG in reward_complete_compare: LLM return response: Based on the provided image comparison to the last frame, it appears the player is now positioned in an area between buildings and is still progressing through the town. The images indicate that the player is actively navigating through the town environment, which is essential to accomplishing the current task of walking out of this town.

Given the slight movement and placement in a context-relevant environment yet not showing significant advancement towards the exit of the town, the following evaluation is provided:

This rating suggests that, although the player is still moving in what seems to be the right direction and within the town, there isn't a substantial improvement over the last frame in terms of nearing the task completion. The complexity of actions needed to complete the task remains comparable.

Considering the scenario where achieving the task entails moving out of the town, the player's current positioning near a probable exit point indicates substantial progress towards accomplishing the task. Therefore, the appropriate evaluation is:

```json

This rating follows because the new frame significantly favors task completion by providing clarity on direction and fewer actions required to exit the town compared to the earlier state.

This relocation further from what seemed like a route leading out of the town indicates a regression in progress toward completing the task of walking out of the town.

The rating should reflect that the player is further from completing the task due to moving away from a key exit area and back into the central part of the town. Therefore, the appropriate evaluation is:

```json

This rating shows that the player needs more actions to complete the task relative to the previous frame, considering the increased distance and detour from the town's exit.

This change does not represent a clear progression towards exiting the town, as it still depicts the player navigating within the town's boundaries without approaching an evident exit.

The provided image does not suggest a direct regression but a lateral movement within the town, indicating that the player’s position concerning the completion of the task (walking up out of the town) has not significantly changed from the last frame. Therefore, the appropriate rating is:

```json

This rating is assigned because the player’s movement does not clearly bring them closer to or further from completing the task. The complexity and actions required to exit the town are unchanged, as the player remains in the urban environment without approaching an exit.

The current image shows the player alongside a different section of the building and closer to a wall, yet still within town limits.

Given the minimal movement and the still centralized location within the town, this does not signify a clear progression towards leaving the town. There's no significant change in the position that would imply being closer or further from the task completion of walking out of the town.

Thus, the appropriate rating would be:

```json
{ "nearly the same": 1.0 }
```

This rating suggests that the player remains in a similar state regarding task completion as before, without significant progress made towards exiting the town. The complexity and actions required to achieve the task are largely unchanged since the player continues to navigate within the town structure.

DEBUG in reward_complete_compare: LLM return response: In this frame compared to the last one, we observe that the player has moved significantly further up within the town. The environment indicates that the player might be near the northern limit of the town or at a leading out point due to the layout of fences and buildings that often indicate town boundaries in the game.

This change of location shows progress towards and actual approach to leaving the town, considerably advancing from the previous positions deep within the town center. Therefore, the frame is a clear improvement over the last in terms of task completion, moving closer to fulfilling the task of walking out of the town. The essence of the transition suggests that essential actions required to complete the task are becoming simpler.

Given this substantial progression, the appropriate rating would be:

```json
{ "much better": 1.0 }
```

This rating implies that the player has entered into a state much more favorable to completing the task than in the previous frame, where the player was navigating between buildings and areas that did not distinctly lead out of the town.
